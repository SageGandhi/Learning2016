It all started one lazy Sunday afternoon in a small village named Karripode, near Pallakad in Kerala. Two school-going friends had 
a crazy idea. They rounded up three goats from the neighborhood and painted the number 1, 2 and 4 on their sides. That night they 
let the goats loose inside their school building. The next morning, when the authorities entered the school, they could smell 
something was wrong. They soon saw goat droppings on the stairs and near the entrance and realized that some goats had entered 
the building. A search was immediately launched and very soon, the three goats were found. But the authorities were worried, where 
was goat No. 3? They spent the rest of the day looking for goat No.3. Gradually there was panic and frustration. The school 
declared classes off for the students for the rest of the day. The teachers, helpers, guards and canteen-boys were all busy 
looking for the goat No. 3, which, of course, was never found. Simply because it did not exist.Those among us who inspite of 
having a good life are always feeling a "lack of fulfilment" are actually looking for the elusive, missing, non-existent goat 
No.3. If you live in the present moment,sound becomes music,movement become dance,smile becomes laughter,mind becomes meditative 
and life becomes a celebration.
